## Building

To preview the project, you need to do three things:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run serve`
3. open [127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000/) in the browser

## Development

What you want is to basically have two terminals:

1. `npm run serve` -- this is providing the [127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000/) "server" and watching changes on Jekyll
2. `npm run watch` -- this is watching all source files and producing dist ones
